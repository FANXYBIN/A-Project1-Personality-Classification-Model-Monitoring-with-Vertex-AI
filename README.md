# A-Project 1: Personality Classification & Model Monitoring with Vertex AI

This project developed an **AutoML personality classification model** using **Google Vertex AI**, predicting whether users are **introverts or extroverts** based on social and behavioral traits.  
The full pipeline included **dataset creation**, **model training**, **evaluation**, **deployment**, and **automated monitoring** to ensure long-term reliability and fairness.

* **Dataset:** 2,900 records, 8 behavioral and social features (e.g., Post Frequency, Friends Circle Size, Stage Fear).  
* **Tools:** Google Vertex AI AutoML, Cloud Monitoring, Python, JSON logs.  
* **Techniques:** AutoML classification, confidence threshold tuning, model deployment, and drift detection via monitoring jobs.  
* **Goal:** Demonstrate responsible AI deployment with explainability and drift tracking.

### 🧱 Model Creation

**1. Dataset Upload**
- Uploaded the CSV dataset to **Vertex AI Datasets** in Google Cloud Storage.  
- Automatically parsed schema with columns such as:
  - `Post_frequency`, `Social_event_attendance`, `Stage_fear`, `Friends_circle_size`, `Time_spent_alone`, `Stress_level`.  
- Labeled the **target column**: `Personality` → *Introvert* or *Extrovert*.  

**2. AutoML Training**
- Used **Vertex AI AutoML Classification** (no-code training).  
- Enabled automatic feature engineering and model tuning.  
- Ran multiple experiments with two confidence thresholds:
  - **0.5** (balanced accuracy vs. coverage)
  - **0.8** (higher precision, lower recall)

**3. Model Evaluation**
- Vertex AI generated precision–recall and confusion matrix visualizations.  
- **Best model:** 0.5 threshold → optimal for user-friendly applications.  
- **Results:**
  - Accuracy: **93–94%**
  - Introvert recall improved from **93% → 94%**
  - Reduced false positives (Introverts misclassified as Extroverts) from **7% → 6%**

### 🧩 Feature Attribution (Explainability)

**Top Features (SHAP Analysis)**  
| Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Post_frequency | ⭐ Highest | High posting frequency = Extroversion |
| Social_event_attendance | ⭐⭐ | Social activity drives Extrovert classification |
| Stage_fear | ⭐⭐ | Low stage fear → Extrovert; high fear → Introvert |
| Time_spent_alone | ⭐ | Longer time alone → Introversion |
| Friends_circle_size | ⭐ | Moderate indicator of social confidence |

### 🧩 Model Monitoring Configuration

**Monitoring Components**
- **Input Drift:** Detects distribution shifts in features.  
- **Prediction Drift:** Identifies output pattern shifts over time.  
- **Attribution Drift:** Detects evolving feature importance patterns.  

**Implementation**
- Configured via **Vertex AI Monitoring**:
  - Drift threshold = 0.1  
  - Enabled **email alerts** on drift detection  
  - Sampling rate: 100% (all predictions logged)  
- Used **Google Cloud Shell** commands to update monitoring jobs and log prediction drift in JSON format.
